# etch-a-sketch
This is another project for The Odin Project Foundation curriculum. It involves significant use of the knowledge of javascript learnt so far in the course.
Etch-a-Sketch helps user to track the motion of the cursor over a dedicated area. The tiles change color as mouse hovers over them. It also includes various options such as color, random color(or rainbow), shade and clear.
